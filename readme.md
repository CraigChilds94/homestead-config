# Homestead Configuration Reader

A simple Express based app which reads & parses your Homestead configuration file. This will eventually have a nice GUI and will enable modifications to the configuration; with automated provisioning and command line access.


Download the .zip the run `npm install; npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`. Currently the app assumes you have a readable file in `~/.homestead/` called `Homestead.yaml`.
